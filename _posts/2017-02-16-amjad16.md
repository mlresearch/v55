title: Trading Bitcoin and Online Time Series Prediction
abstract: 'Given live streaming Bitcoin activity, we aim to forecast future Bitcoin
  prices so as to execute profitable trades. We show that Bitcoin price data exhibit
  desirable properties such as stationarity and mixing. Even so, some classical time
  series prediction methods that exploit this behavior, such as ARIMA models, produce
  poor predictions and also lack a probabilistic interpretation. In light of these
  limitations, we make two contributions: first, we introduce a theoretical framework
  for predicting and trading ternary-state Bitcoin price changes, i.e. increase, decrease
  or no-change; and second, using the framework, we present simple, scalable and real-time
  algorithms that achieve a high return on average Bitcoin investment (e.g. 6-7x,
  4-6x and 3-6x return on investments for tests in 2014, 2015 and 2016), while consistently
  maintaining a high prediction accuracy (> 60-70%) and respectable Sharpe Ratio (>
  2.0). Furthermore, when trained on a period eight months earlier than the test period,
  our algorithms performed nearly as well as they did when trained on recent data!
  As an important contribution, we provide a justification for why it makes sense
  to use classification algorithms in settings where the underlying time series is
  stationary and mixing.'
