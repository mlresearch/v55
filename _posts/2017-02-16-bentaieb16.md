title: Sparse and Smooth Adjustments for Coherent Forecasts in Temporal Aggregation
  of Time Series
abstract: Independent forecasts obtained from different temporal aggregates of a given
  time series may not be mutually consistent. State-of the art forecasting methods
  usually apply adjustments on the individual level forecasts to satisfy the aggregation
  constraints. These adjustments require the estimation of the covariance between
  the individual forecast errors at all aggregation levels. In order to keep a maximum
  number of individual forecasts unaffected by estimation errors, we propose a new
  forecasting algorithm that provides sparse and smooth adjustments while still preserving
  the aggregation constraints. The algorithm computes the revised forecasts by solving
  a generalized lasso problem. It is shown that it not only provides accurate forecasts,
  but also applies a significantly smaller number of adjustments to the base forecasts
  in a large-scale smart meter dataset.
