title: Influential Node Detection in Implicit Social Networks using Multi-task Gaussian
  Copula Models
abstract: Influential node detection is a central research topic in social network
  analysis. Many existing methods rely on the assumption that the network structure
  is completely known a priori. However, in many applications, network structure is
  unavailable to explain the underlying information diffusion phenomenon. To address
  the challenge of information diffusion analysis with incomplete knowledge of network
  structure, we develop a multi-task low rank linear influence model. By exploiting
  the relationships between contagions, our approach can simultaneously predict the
  volume (i.e. time series prediction) for each contagion (or topic) and automatically
  identify the most influential nodes for each contagion. The proposed model is validated
  using synthetic data and an ISIS twitter dataset. In addition to improving the volume
  prediction performance significantly, we show that the proposed approach can reliably
  infer the most influential users for specific contagions.
