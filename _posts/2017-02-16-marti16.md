title: 'Exploring and measuring non-linear correlations: Copulas, Lightspeed Transportation
  and Clustering'
abstract: We propose a methodology to explore and measure the pairwise correlations
  that exist between variables in a dataset. The methodology leverages copulas for
  encoding dependence between two variables, state-of-the-art optimal transport for
  providing a relevant geometry to the copulas, and clustering for summarizing the
  main dependence patterns found between the variables. Some of the clusters centers
  can be used to parameterize a novel dependence coefficient which can target or forget
  specific dependence patterns. Finally, we illustrate and benchmark the methodology
  on several datasets. Code and numerical experiments are available online at https://www.datagrapple.com/Tech
  for reproducible research.
