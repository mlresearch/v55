title: A central limit theorem with application to inference in α-stable regression
  models
abstract: It is well known that the α-stable distribution, while having no closed
  form density function in the general case, admits a Poisson series representation
  (PSR) in which the terms of the series are a function of the arrival times of a
  unit rate Poisson process. In our previous work we have shown how to carry out inference
  for regression models using this series representation, which leads to a very convenient
  conditionally Gaussian framework, amenable to straightforward Gaussian inference
  procedures.  The PSR has to be truncated to a finite number of terms for practical
  purposes. The residual terms have been approximated in our previous work by a Gaussian
  distribution with fully characterised moments. In this paper we present a new Central
  Limit Theorem (CLT) for the residual terms which serves to justify our previous
  approximation of the residual as Gaussian.  Furthermore, we provide an analysis
  of the asymptotic convergence rate expressed in the CLT.
